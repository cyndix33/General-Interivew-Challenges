###Array Hopper
Minimum number of jumps to reach end
Given an array of integers where each element represents the max number of steps that can be made forward from that element. Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array (starting from the first element). If an element is 0, then cannot move through that element.

Example:

Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9}
Output: 3 (1-> 3 -> 8 ->9)
First element is 1, so can only go to 3. Second element is 3, so can make at most 3 steps eg to 5 or 8 or 9.

###Parse Float without using the function
Write a function (in Javascript) that given a string will return a float value for that string. It should handle any string passed into it. Do not use parseFloat();. Deliver the file in the .js format.
